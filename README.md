**In order to execute all the code follow the next steps:**
1. Download the Dataset and notebook file
2. Upload the Dataset to your google drive
3. Upload the "Machine_Learning.ipynb" file on google colab
4. Make sure to use the GPU as hardware acceleration device :D
5. Run all the code except LOAD MODEL AND GENERATE STATISTICS PLOTS TO AVOID TRAINING AGAIN

**If you just want to try the model and not spend time training it:**
1. Download the Dataset, notebook file and model
2. Upload the Dataset to your google drive
3. Upload the "Machine_Learning.ipynb" file on google colab
4. Upload the model to your google drive
5. Run the code with the drive import 
6. Run the code under the title: LOAD MODEL AND GENERATE STATISTICS PLOTS TO AVOID TRAINING AGAIN
7. Run predicting code: FUNCTION TO PREDICT THE POKEMONS

Note: This pokemon classifier only works with first generation pokemon images
